Chapter 2: Sensor Systems and Perception in Physical AI

Meta Description: Comprehensive coverage of sensor technologies, perception algorithms, and multi-modal integration for robotic systems. Learn how robots sense their environment through vision, touch, proprioception, and other modalities, and how raw sensor data is transformed into actionable understanding.

The Perception Pipeline in Robotics
Perception forms the foundation of any intelligent physical system. Without accurate sensing and interpretation of the environment, even the most sophisticated control algorithms cannot produce appropriate behaviors. The perception pipeline transforms raw sensor measurements into structured representations that support decision-making and action.
This pipeline typically consists of several stages: signal acquisition, preprocessing and filtering, feature extraction, and high-level interpretation. Each stage adds semantic meaning while reducing dimensionality, transforming millions of pixel values into actionable concepts like "obstacle ahead" or "graspable object." Understanding this transformation process is essential for designing and troubleshooting robotic perception systems.
Visual Perception Systems
Camera Technologies and Image Formation
Cameras are the most information-rich sensors available to robots, capturing dense spatial information about the environment. Understanding camera optics, image formation, and sensor characteristics is fundamental to working with visual perception systems. The pinhole camera model provides the mathematical foundation for relating 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates.
Modern robotic systems employ various camera types depending on application requirements. RGB cameras provide color information useful for object recognition and scene understanding. Depth cameras, including structured light sensors and time-of-flight cameras, directly measure distance to surfaces, simplifying 3D reconstruction. Event cameras represent an emerging technology that captures changes in brightness with microsecond resolution and minimal motion blur.
Camera calibration is essential for accurate perception. Intrinsic calibration determines the camera's focal length, principal point, and distortion parameters. Extrinsic calibration establishes the camera's position and orientation relative to the robot's coordinate frame. Multi-camera systems require careful calibration to enable stereo vision or create omnidirectional awareness.
Computer Vision Fundamentals
Classical computer vision provides tools for extracting geometric and photometric information from images. Edge detection algorithms identify boundaries between regions with different intensities. Feature detectors like SIFT, SURF, and ORB find distinctive keypoints that can be matched across images, enabling applications from object recognition to visual odometry.
Image segmentation divides an image into meaningful regions. Threshold-based methods work for controlled environments with predictable lighting, while more sophisticated algorithms handle complex scenes. Region growing, watershed transforms, and graph-cut methods each offer different trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
Optical flow estimates the motion of pixels between consecutive frames, providing information about the robot's movement and dynamic objects in the scene. This low-level motion information supports higher-level tasks like obstacle avoidance, tracking, and structure from motion.

Deep Learning for Visual Perception
Deep learning has revolutionized robotic vision, enabling end-to-end learning from raw pixels to task-relevant outputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically learn hierarchical feature representations, from simple edges and textures to complex object parts and categories.
Object detection networks like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet can identify and localize multiple objects in real-time. These systems output bounding boxes and class labels, enabling robots to recognize and track objects of interest. Instance segmentation networks extend this capability by providing pixel-level masks for each detected object.
Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel in the image, creating dense scene understanding. Networks like U-Net, DeepLab, and Mask R-CNN enable robots to distinguish drivable surfaces from obstacles, identify manipulable objects, and understand scene layout. This dense prediction capability is essential for navigation and manipulation tasks.

Haptic Feedback and Tactile Arrays
Tactile arrays provide spatially resolved contact information, analogous to human fingerprints. These arrays of individual sensing elements (taxels) can determine contact location, shape, and pressure distribution. High-resolution tactile arrays enable robots to detect slip, identify objects through touch, and execute dexterous manipulation tasks.
Integrating tactile sensing into robot control presents significant challenges. Processing high-dimensional tactile data in real-time requires efficient algorithms. Learning useful representations from tactile information remains an active research area, with approaches ranging from handcrafted features to end-to-end learning with neural networks.
Proprioceptive and Inertial Sensing
Joint Position and Velocity Sensing
Proprioception—the sense of self-movement and body position—is fundamental to robotic control. Encoders measure joint angles in articulated robots, providing the basic feedback necessary for position control. Optical encoders offer high resolution by counting transitions of patterned disks, while magnetic encoders provide robustness to contamination.

Summary and Future Directions
This chapter has surveyed the rich landscape of sensing technologies and perception algorithms that enable Physical AI systems. From visual perception using cameras and deep learning to tactile sensing for manipulation, from proprioceptive awareness to multimodal fusion, we have explored how robots sense and interpret their environment.
